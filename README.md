blogMV* Skeleton
================

This is the skeleton which we are gonna use to build our SPA with Backbone and
other technologies through an API built with Python using Google App Engine to
host blogMV* data.

**Attention:** Do not forget to do `bower install` on baby-steps folder to get your
front-end dependencies (jQuery and Bootstrap so far) working.
